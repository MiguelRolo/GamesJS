## How to play? 🕹️

As you start the game, the tetriminos will start to cascade down from the top of the grid and collect at the base. 

To win, you'll need to rotate the Tetriminos so they fit together perfectly and form rows that span the entire playing field. With each clear, the line disappears from the grid. 

Once the Tetriminos have climbed to the top of the grid, the game is over.

Keys:
- ⬆️ *(Up Arrow Key)*- **Rotate Piece**
- ⬅️ ➡️ *(Left/Right Arrow Key)* - **Move Piece**
- ⬇️ *(Down Arrow Key)* - **Move Down Piece**
- *`SPACE`* *(Space Bar)* - **Drop Piece**
- *`P`* - **Pause Game**
- *`N`* - **New Game**
